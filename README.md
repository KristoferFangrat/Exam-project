# Exam-project

## Tim & Kristofer

The goal for the project is to merge two different data sources to a shared pipeline to be cleaned and transformed before getting stored in a cloud storage. The transformed data will then be visualized in a web application that presents relevant information in a neat and user-friendly manner. The two sources are two separated APIs, one from the Swedish Police and the other from a weather service. The result is a web application that gives the user multiple filtering options to view different events and the possibility to see the actual weather during the specific event. The project uses the modern data stack where new techniques are being used in all stages for the ETL pipeline.
